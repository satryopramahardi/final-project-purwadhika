### by: Satryo Pramahardi

A clustering experiment by using OPTICS algorithm to cluster the coordinates of crime incidents in Chicago.
This experiment clusters each 100 crimes to a single data point. Hopefully this information may helps the alocation of police patrol routes.

Run the App:
> python index.py

Using:
* Sklearn for OPTICS clustering
* Folium for mapping
* Dash and Plotly for frontend
* Pandas and Numpy for data cleaning and analysis
